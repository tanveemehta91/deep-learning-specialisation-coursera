# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

### Summary

I wanted to create a repo with all the assignments that I did for Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera. All the code base and images in this repo have been taken from [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by `deeplearning.ai`, unless specified otherwise.

I really enjoyed these 5 courses, which are very well thought through and explained in an amazingly succinct manner yet covering all the essential concepts of Deep Neural Networks, including things to keep in mind whilst applying these concepts in a business context. Although I do believe these courses are designed in a manner that they might be easier to learn from for someone who has a mathematical background.

Note: Please do not use this as a source to copy the code for your assignments.

### Setup

Run ```setup.sh``` to (i) download a pre-trained VGG-19 dataset and (ii) extract the zip'd pre-trained models and datasets that are needed for all the assignments. Credits to [Aman Chadha](https://github.com/amanchadha/coursera-deep-learning-specialization/tree/master) for this.
